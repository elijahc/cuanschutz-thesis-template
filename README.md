# University of Colorado Denver | Anschutz Medical Campus Ph.D. Thesis Template

This work is a fork of [https://github.com/dewittpe/ucd-thesis-template](https://github.com/dewittpe/ucd-thesis-template)

His original latex files are in [/latex](/latex)

In 2020 I attempted to use his files to write my dissertation in latex, but found it hard difficult to write efficiently (let alone pass around drafts)


I've included the [2020 format guide](/Format-Guide.pdf) in this repo but uptodate ones can be found on the [graduate school resources page](https://graduateschool.ucdenver.edu/forms-resources/resources)


I ultimately ended up creating word template file based on this guide that conforms to the recs laid out in the format guide included in:
- [docx](/docx)

`dissertation_cited_brief.docx` is a short version of the final pdf included.

`cuanschutz_dissertation.dotx` contains a word template file usable as a starting point for writing your own

## Styles
If you use the embedded styles, you can autogenerate a TOC. It does this by finding sections using the predefined styles and indexing their page numbers

![styles](/docx/styles.png)

This TOC meets the format guidelines for a table of contents

> Right click a style and select `Select all X instances` to see where a particular style is used.

Highlight the entire table and from the references menu click `Update Table` at the far left of the toolbar to update the table with any changed/added/updated table headings and page numbers

## Citations

At the time I had been using the now-defunct Papers 3 standalone app
before it was [acquired by ReadCube/Nature Publishing Group](https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2016/03/readcube-acquires-papers-springer-nature/) and became a subscription product. 

I'm sure you can find an alternative. I think [Bookends](https://paleowave.net/paleowave/2019/3/15/transitioning-from-papers-3-to-bookends-part-2-the-how) is a highly recommended alternative.

## Notes
This template is a good start, but there is no guarantee that using this
template will produce a document passing the graduate school format review.
You will likely need to tweak a line or two within your dissertation.  I did.
