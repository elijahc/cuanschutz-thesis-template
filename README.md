# University of Colorado Denver | Anschutz Medical Campus Ph.D. Thesis Template

This work is a fork of [https://github.com/dewittpe/ucd-thesis-template](https://github.com/dewittpe/ucd-thesis-template)

His original latex files are in [/latex](/latex)

In 2020 I attempted to use his files to write my dissertation in latex, but found it hard difficult to write efficiently (let alone pass around drafts)
I've included the [/Format-Guide.pdf](2020 format guide) in this repo but uptodate ones can be found on the [graduate school resources page](https://graduateschool.ucdenver.edu/forms-resources/resources)
I ultimately ended up creating word template file based on this guide that conforms to the recs laid out in the format guide




## Notes
This template is a good start, but there is no guarantee that using this
template will produce a document passing the graduate school format review.
You will likely need to tweak a line or two within your dissertation.  I did.
